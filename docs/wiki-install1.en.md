## Installation ##

Lest assume the following environment:
1. A local install, so all will be **refered into the** `127.0.0.1` **address ip** machine.
2. Has access to a terminal program with **console and a root/administrator access/password** to type commands.
3. Has access to a **MySQL/MariaDB database with a username** and their respective password.

The easy and **simples way its put all the files in root web** server, by example if root web server are `/var/www/html` 
then put the complete osticket files inside a new directory **as `/var/www/html/simpleticket/`** then..

A **professional way its to use aliasing**, this means download in a directory away from webroot, 
then make aliasing of the real path directory to the webb root place into the web server.

### Pre-setup preparation and file permission###

osTicket installer requires ability to write to the configuration file, `include/ost-config.php` so then 
before start to install, **get sure you copy the ost-sampleconfig.php file to ost-config.php inside include** directory.

**once done, open a browser and call `http://127.0.0.1/simpleticket`** the setup program will redirect 
to proper screen to install.

### Procedure setup screen ###

**Pre-setup installation data**: osTicket's installation script will attempt to auto-detect paths and any permission issues. 

* If the script spots any configuration errors then it will not allow you to continue until the errors are corrected.
* If everything checks out, **you will be presented with a form to fill in the required information**.

Please **fill** the user admin login, names, info, **database user, name and address, and very important, emails of admin and system.**

* Fill database username and password, also the database name
* Email user admin and email for send or system mail must be different, Email will work only with php-mail module enabled.
* If any errors occurs, go back and check the data entered.
* On valid data the script will create and populate the database plus write a configuration file.

Note that the installer performs basic configuration required to get osTicket up and running. 
Further configuration is required, post-install, to make the system fully functional. 

Your next step is to configure and usage of the system please read [wiki-configure-index.md](wiki-configure-index.md)
to configure and parametrize your installation and then finally read [wiki-usage-index.md](wiki-usage-index.md).
